<h1 id="custom-id" align="center">GHRI Bot</h1>

The GHRI Bot is a ***College inquiry Chatbot*** by using Python Programming language. This is a command-line project that analyzes the user’s queries and understands the user's message. At the most basic level, a chatbot is a computer program that simulates and processes human conversation (either written or spoken), allowing humans to interact with digital devices as if they were communicating with a real person.
